# SOLAR-RAON-SENSING-CLOTHES-DRYING-STAND

DESCRIPTION:

The Solar Rain Sensing Clothes Drying Stand is an automatic system designed to dry clothes
efficiently using solar energy while protecting them from unexpected rain. The setup combines renewable energy and smart automation to improve convenience and sustainability in everyday laundry drying.
The system uses a rain sensor to detect raindrops and an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to sense sunlight intensity. When rain is detected, the Arduino Uno microcontroller automatically activates a DC motor or servo mechanism to pull a protective cover over the clothes or retract the stand to prevent clothes from getting wet. Once the rain stops and sunlight is detected again, the system reopens for drying.
A solar panel powers the entire circuit, storing energy in a rechargeable battery to ensure operation even during cloudy weather. The setup also includes relays, motor drivers, and sensors connected through Arduino, programmed in C/C++ for real-time control and automation.

HOW DOES IT WORKS?

The solar panel powers the system and charges the battery.
The rain sensor detects rainfall and signals the Arduino Uno.
The Arduino activates a motor to cover or retract the clothes stand.
When the rain stops and sunlight returns, the stand reopens automatically.
